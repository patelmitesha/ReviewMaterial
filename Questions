Q. Software Testing
A. Software Testing is a  process, to evaluate the functionality of a software application with an intent to find whether the developed software met the specified requirements or not and to identify the defects to ensure that the product is defect-free in order to produce a quality product.


Q. Types of Testing
A. 
	- Unit Testing : It focuses on the smallest unit of software design. In this, we test an individual unit or group of interrelated units. It is often done by the programmer by using sample input and observing its corresponding outputs. 
		#  In a program we are checking if loop, method or function is working fine
		#  Misunderstood or incorrect, arithmetic precedence
		#  Incorrect initialization
	-  Integration Testing : software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction between these software modules when they are integrated.
		# Top-down Approach
		# Bottom-up Approach 
		# Sandwich Approach
		# Big-Bang  
	- Regression Testing : Every time a new module is added leads to changes in the program. This type of testing makes sure that the whole component works properly even after adding components to the complete program. 
	- Smoke Testing : performed post software build to verify that the critical functionalities of software are working fine.
	- Black Box : It is used for validation. In this we ignore internal working mechanism and focuse on what is the output?
	- White Box : It is used for verification. In this we focus on internal mechanism i.e. how the output is achieved?
	- Alpha Testing : This is a type of validation testing. It is a type of acceptance testing which is done before the product is released to customers. Performed internally within the organization
	- Beta Testing : The beta test is conducted at one or more customer sites by the end-user of the software. This version is released for a limited number of users for testing in a real-time environment
	- System Testing : performed on a complete integrated system to evaluate the compliance of the system with the corresponding requirements
	- Performance Testing: Performance Testing is a type of software testing that is carried out to test the speed, scalability, stability and reliability of the software product or application.
	- Load Testing: Load Testing is a type of software Testing which is carried out to determine the behavior of a system or software product under extreme load.
	- Stress Testing: Stress Testing is a type of software testing performed to check the robustness of the system under the varying loads.
	- Security Testing

Q. Stubs and Drivers
A. Stubs and Drivers are the dummy programs in Integration testing used to facilitate the software testing activity. These programs act as a substitutes for the missing models in the testing. They do not implement the entire programming logic of the software module but they simulate data communication with the calling module while testing.
	- Stub: Is called by the Module under Test.
	- Driver: Calls the Module to be tested.

Q. Database Management System
A. DBMS is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while considering appropriate security measures.

Q. Database
A. A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.

Q. Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS)
A. A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.

Q. Codd's Rule for Relational DBMS
A. 
	- Rule 1: Information rule - All information(including metadata) is to be represented as stored data in cells of tables. The rows and columns have to be strictly unordered.
	- Rule 2: Guaranted Access - Each unique piece of data(atomic value) should be accesible by : Table Name + Primary Key(Row) + Attribute(column).
	- Rule 3: Systematic treatment of NULL - Null has several meanings, it can mean missing data, not applicable or no value. It should be handled consistently. Expression on NULL must give null.
	- Rule 4: Active Online Catalog - Database dictionary(catalog) is the structure description of the complete Database and it must be stored online. The Catalog must be governed by same rules as rest of the database. The same query language should be used on catalog as used to query database.
	- Rule 5: Powerful and Well-Structured Language - One well structured language must be there to provide all manners of access to the data stored in the database. Example: SQL, etc. If the database allows access to the data without the use of this language, then that is a violation.
	- Rule 6: View Updation Rule - All the view that are theoretically updatable should be updatable by the system as well.
	- Rule 7: Relational Level Operation - There must be Insert, Delete, Update operations at each level of relations. Set operation like Union, Intersection and minus should also be supported.
	- Rule 8: Physical Data Independence - The physical storage of data should not matter to the system. If say, some file supporting table is renamed or moved from one disk to another, it should not effect the application.
	- Rule 9: Logical Data Independence - If there is change in the logical structure(table structures) of the database the user view of data should not change. Say, if a table is split into two tables, a new view should give result as the join of the two tables. This rule is most difficult to satisfy.
	- Rule 10: Integrity Independence - The database should be able to enforce its own integrity rather than using other programs. Key and Check constraints, trigger etc, should be stored in Data Dictionary. This also make RDBMS independent of front-end.
	- Rule 11: Distribution Independence - A database should work properly regardless of its distribution across a network. Even if a database is geographically distributed, with data stored in pieces, the end user should get an impression that it is stored at the same place. This lays the foundation of distributed database.
	- Rule 12: Nonsubversion Rule - If low level access is allowed to a system it should not be able to subvert or bypass integrity rules to change the data. This can be achieved by some sort of looking or encryption.

Q. What is Database Normalization ?
A. Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy from a relation or set of relations. Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion and updation anomalies.
	- 1st Normal Form : A relation is in 1NF, if every attribute in that relation is singled valued attribute.
	- 2nd Normal Form : A relation is in 2NF, if it has No Partial Dependency, i.e., no non-prime attribute (attributes which are not part of any candidate key) is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the table.
	- 3rd Normal Form : A relation is in 3NF, if there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes as well as it is in second normal form.
	- Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) : A relation is in BCNF iff in every non-trivial functional dependency X –> Y, X is a super key.

Q. OSI Model
A. The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. It consists of 7 Layers
	- Physical Layer : Is concerned with electrically or optically transmitting raw unstructured data bits across the network
	- Data Link Layer :  Directly connected nodes are used to perform node-to-node data transfer where data is packaged into frames. The data link layer also corrects errors that may have occurred at the physical layer.
	- Network Layer :  Responsible for receiving frames from the data link layer, and delivering them to their intended destinations among based on the addresses contained inside the frame.
	- Transport Layer : Manages the delivery and error checking of data packets. It regulates the size, sequencing, and ultimately the transfer of data between systems and hosts. One of the most common examples of the transport layer is TCP or the Transmission Control Protocol.
	- Session Layer : The session layer controls the conversations between different computers. A session or connection between machines is set up, managed, and termined at layer 5. Session layer services also include authentication and reconnections.
	- Presentation Layer : The presentation layer formats or translates data for the application layer based on the syntax or semantics that the application accepts. This layer can also handle the encryption and decryption required by the application layer.
	- Application Layer : At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact directly with the software application. This layer sees network services provided to end-user applications such as a web browser.

Q. TCP/IP Model
A.  Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is actual implementation of standard protocols. It consists of 5 layers
	- Application Layer : It looks out for hardware addressing and the protocols present in this layer allows for the physical transmission of data
	- Transport Layer : It defines the protocols which are responsible for logical transmission of data over the entire network.
		# Internet Protocol
		# ICMP
		# ARP
	- Internet Layer : It is responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data.
		# TCP
		# UDP
	- Network Access Layer
		# HTTP and HTTPS
		# SSH
		# NTP

Q. What is Deadlock
A. In an operating system, a deadlock occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting state because a requested system resource is held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process. (URL : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-deadlocks-in-operating-system)
	- Deadlock can arise if the following four conditions hold simultaneously (Necessary Conditions) also called Coffman Conditions
		# Mutual Exclusion: One or more than one resource are non-shareable (Only one process can use at a time) 
		# Hold and Wait: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for resources. 
		# No Preemption: A resource cannot be taken from a process unless the process releases the resource. 
		# Circular Wait: A set of processes are waiting for each other in circular form. 
	- There are three ways to handle deadlock 
		# Deadlock prevention or avoidance: The idea is to not let the system into a deadlock state.  Banker’s algorithm (Which is in-turn a gift from Dijkstra) in order to avoid deadlock. 
		# Deadlock detection and recovery: Let deadlock occur, then do preemption to handle it once occurred. 
		# Ignore the problem altogether: If deadlock is very rare, then let it happen and reboot the system. This is the approach that both Windows and UNIX take. 

Q. What is Startvation ?
A. Starvation happens if a method is indefinitely delayed. This can emerge once a method needs a further resource for execution that isn’t assigned. Starvation is the problem that occurs when low priority processes get jammed for an unspecified time as the high priority processes keep executing.


Q. What is Aging ?
A. To avoid starvation, we use the concept of Aging. In Aging, after some fixed amount of time quantum, we increase the priority of the low priority processes. 

Q. What is Kernal ?
A. The kernel is a computer program considered as a central component or module of OS. It is responsible for handling, managing, and controlling all operations of computer systems and hardware. It also acts as an interface between user applications and hardware.

Q. OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities and Mitigation Techniques
A. 
	- Injection : A code injection happens when an attacker sends invalid data to the web application with the intention to make it do something that the application was not designed/programmed to do.
		# Prevention : 	
			1. Prepared Statements
			2. Use positive or “allowlist” server-side input validation.
			3. For any residual dynamic queries, escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter.
			4. Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass disclosure of records in case of SQL injection.
	- Broken authentication :  can allow an attacker to use manual and/or automatic methods to try to gain control over any account they want in a system – or even worse – to gain complete control over the system.
		# Prevention :
			1. Implement multi-factor authentication
			2. Do not ship or deploy with any default credentials
			3. Implement weak-password checks
			4. Align password length, complexity and rotation policies
			5. Use a server-side, secure, built-in session manager that generates a new random session ID.
	- Sensitive data exposure
		# Prevention :
			1. Don’t store sensitive data unnecessarily.
			2. Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data at rest.
			3. Disable caching for responses that contain sensitive data.
			4. Store passwords using strong adaptive and salted hashing function
	- XML external entities (XXE) : This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser.
		# Prevention :
			1. Whenever possible, use less complex data formats ,such as JSON
			2. Patch or upgrade all XML processors and libraries
			3. Implement positive (“allowlisting”) server-side input validation, filtering, or sanitization to prevent hostile data within XML documents, headers, or nodes.
	- Broken access control
		# Prevention :
			1. With the exception of public resources, deny by default.
			2. Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata (e.g. .git) and backup files are not present within web roots.
			3. Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate.
			4. Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling.
			5. JWT tokens should be invalidated on the server after logout
	- Security misconfigurations
		# Unpatched flaws, Default configurations, Unused pages, Unprotected files and directories, Unnecessary services
		# Prevention : 
			1. A repeatable hardening process
			2. Intall minimal platform without any unnecessary features, components, documentation, and samples. 
			3. Sending security directives to clients, e.g. Security Headers.
	- Cross site scripting (XSS) : XSS attacks consist of injecting malicious client-side scripts into a website and using the website as a propagation method.
		# Prevention :
			1. Using frameworks that automatically escape XSS by design
			2. Escaping untrusted HTTP request data
			3. Applying context-sensitive encoding 
			4. Enabling a content security policy (CSP) is a defense-in-depth mitigating control against XSS. 
	- Insecure deserialization
		# Prevention : 
			1. Implementing integrity checks such as digital signatures
			2. Isolating and running code that deserializes in low privilege environments when possible.
			3. Logging deserialization exceptions and failures
			4. Restricting or monitoring incoming and outgoing network connectivity from containers or servers that deserialize.
			5. Monitoring deserialization, alerting if a user deserializes constantly.
	- Using components with known vulnerabilities
		# Prevention : 
			1. Remove all unnecessary dependencies.
			2. Monitor sources like Common Vulnerabilities and Disclosures (CVE) and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for vulnerabilities in the components.
			3. Obtain components only from official sources.
			4. Get rid of components not actively maintained.
			5. Use virtual patching with the help of a Website Application Firewall.
	- Insufficient logging and monitoring
		# Prevention :
			1. Remote monitoring
			2. Website blocklist monitoring
			3. Server-side monitoring
			4. DNS monitoring
			5. Uptime monitoring
	- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) : attack forces a logged-on victim's browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the victim's session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a vulnerable web application.
		# Prevention
			1. Implement mechanisms like CAPTCHA, Re-Authentication, and Unique Request Tokens (CSRF Tokens).

Q. What is a botnet?
A Botnet is a network of devices that has been infected with malicious software, such as a virus. Attackers can control a botnet as a group without the owner’s knowledge with the goal of increasing the magnitude of their attacks. Often, a botnet is used to overwhelm systems in a distributed-denial-of-service attack (DDoS) attack.

Q. What is Fishing Attack ?
A. Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. 

Q. Types of Cyber Attacks?
A.	- Phishing : practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source
		# Email phishing
		# HTTPS phishing - Send link of fake website
		# Spear phishing - Although spear phishing uses email, they target specific individuals within the organization using real names, job functions, or work telephone numbers to make the recipient think the email is from someone else inside the organization.
		# Whaling/CEO fraud -  Malicious actors use social media or the corporate website to find the name of the organization’s CEO or another senior leadership member. They then impersonate that person using a similar email address. The email might ask for a money transfer or request that the recipient review a document.
		# Vishing : Voice phishing, or “vishing,” happens when a cybercriminal calls a phone number and creates a heightened sense of urgency that makes a person take an action against their best interests. 
		# Smishing : Smishing is sending texts that request a person take an action. Often, the text will include a link that, when clicked, installs malware on the user’s device.
		# Angler phishing : Angler phishing is when a cybercriminal uses notifications or direct messaging features in a social media application to entice someone into taking action.
		# Pharming :  The malicious actors hijack a Domain Name Server (DNS), the server that translates URLs from natural language into IP addresses. Then, when a user types in the website address, the DNS server redirects the user to a malicious website’s IP address that might look real.
		# Pop-up phishing : . Malicious actors can place malicious code in the small notification boxes, called pop-ups, that show up when people go to websites. 
		# Clone phishing :  Malicious actors know most of the business applications that require people to click links as part of their daily activities. They will often engage in research to see what types of services an organization uses regularly then send targeted emails that appear to come from these services.
		# Evil twin :  is a phishing attack uses a fake WiFi hotspot, often making it look legitimate, that might intercept data during transfer. . If someone uses the fake hotspot, the malicious actors can engage in man-in-the-middle or eavesdropping attacks.
		# Watering hole phishing : malicious actors doing research around the websites a company’s employees visit often, then infecting the IP address with malicious code or downloads. These can be websites that provide industry news or third-party vendors’ websites. When the user visits the website, they download the malicious code.
	- Malware : Malicious software can be described as unwanted software that is installed in your system without your consent.
		# Macro viruses : These viruses infect applications such as Microsoft Word or Excel. 
		# File infectors : File infector viruses usually attach themselves to executable code, such as .exe files. The virus is installed when the code is loaded.
		# System or boot : record infectors — A boot-record virus attaches to the master boot record on hard disks.
		# Polymorphic viruses : These viruses conceal themselves through varying cycles of encryption and decryption.
		# Stealth viruses : Stealth viruses take over system functions to conceal themselves
		# Trojans : A Trojan or a Trojan horse is a program that hides in a useful program and usually has a malicious function. A major difference between viruses and Trojans is that Trojans do not self-replicate.
		# Logic bombs : A logic bomb is a type of malicious software that is appended to an application and is triggered by a specific occurrence, such as a logical condition or a specific date and time.
		# Worms : Worms differ from viruses in that they do not attach to a host file, but are self-contained programs that propagate across networks and computers. 
		# Droppers : A dropper is a program used to install viruses on computers. In many instances, the dropper is not infected with malicious code and, therefore might not be detected by virus-scanning software.
		# Ransomware : Ransomware is a type of malware that blocks access to the victim’s data and threatens to publish or delete it unless a ransom is paid. 
		# Adware : Adware is a software application used by companies for marketing purposes; advertising banners are displayed while any program is running.
		# spyware : Covertly obtains information by transmitting data from the hard drive
	- Man-in-the-middle attack : also known as eavesdropping attacks, occur when attackers insert themselves into a two-party transaction. Once the attackers interrupt the traffic, they can filter, alter or steal data.
		# Session hijacking : attacker hijacks a session between a trusted client and network server. The attacking computer substitutes its IP address for the trusted client while the server continues the session, believing it is communicating with the client. 
		# IP Spoofing : IP spoofing is used by an attacker to convince a system that it is communicating with a known, trusted entity and provide the attacker with access to the system. 
		# Replay : A replay attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and saves old messages and then tries to send them later, impersonating one of the participants. 
	- Denial-of-service attack (DoS) : A denial-of-service attack floods systems, servers, or networks with traffic to exhaust resources and bandwidth.
		# TCP SYN flood attack : An attacker exploits the use of the buffer space during a TCP session initialization handshake. The attacker’s device floods the target system’s small in-process queue with connection requests, but it does not sends acknowlegement signal. This causes the target system to time out while waiting for the response from the attacker’s device, which makes the system crash or become unusable when the connection queue fills up.	
		# Teardrop attack : This attack causes the length and fragmentation offset fields in sequential Internet Protocol (IP) packets to overlap one another on the attacked host; the attacked system attempts to reconstruct packets during the process but fails. The target system then becomes confused and crashes.
		# Smurf attack : This attack involves using IP spoofing and the ICMP to saturate a target network with traffic. This attack method uses ICMP echo requests targeted at broadcast IP addresses. This process is repeatable, and can be automated to generate huge amounts of network congestion.
		# Ping of death attack : This type of attack uses IP packets to ‘ping a target system with an IP size over the maximum of 65,535 bytes. IP packets of this size are not allowed, so attacker fragments the IP packet. Once the target system reassembles the packet, it can experience buffer overflows and other crashes.
		# Botnets - Botnets are the millions of systems infected with malware under hacker control in order to carry out DDoS attacks. These bots or zombie systems are used to carry out attacks against the target systems, often overwhelming the target system’s bandwidth and processing capabilities.
	- Distributed Denial-of-service attack :  DDoS attack is also an attack on system’s resources, but it is launched from a large number of other host machines that are infected by malicious software controlled by the attacker.
	- SQL injection : Injection occurs when an attacker inserts malicious code into a server that uses SQL and forces the server to reveal information it normally would not.
	- Zero-day exploit : A zero-day exploit hits after a network vulnerability is announced but before a patch or solution is implemented.
	- DNS Tunneling - 
	- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack : XSS attacks use third-party web resources to run scripts in the victim’s web browser or scriptable application.
	- Drive-by attack : 
	- Password attack : 
		# Brute-force : password guessing means using a random approach by trying different passwords
		# dictionary attack : A dictionary of common passwords is used to attempt to gain access to a user’s computer and network. Attacker injects a payload with malicious JavaScript into a website’s database.
