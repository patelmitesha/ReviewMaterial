Q. Software Testing
A. Software Testing is a  process, to evaluate the functionality of a software application with an intent to find whether the developed software met the specified requirements or not and to identify the defects to ensure that the product is defect-free in order to produce a quality product.


Q. Types of Testing
A. 
	- Unit Testing : It focuses on the smallest unit of software design. In this, we test an individual unit or group of interrelated units. It is often done by the programmer by using sample input and observing its corresponding outputs. 
		#  In a program we are checking if loop, method or function is working fine
		#  Misunderstood or incorrect, arithmetic precedence
		#  Incorrect initialization
	-  Integration Testing : software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction between these software modules when they are integrated.
		# Top-down Approach
		# Bottom-up Approach 
		# Sandwich Approach
		# Big-Bang  
	- Regression Testing : Every time a new module is added leads to changes in the program. This type of testing makes sure that the whole component works properly even after adding components to the complete program. 
	- Smoke Testing : performed post software build to verify that the critical functionalities of software are working fine.
	- Black Box : It is used for validation. In this we ignore internal working mechanism and focuse on what is the output?
	- White Box : It is used for verification. In this we focus on internal mechanism i.e. how the output is achieved?
	- Alpha Testing : This is a type of validation testing. It is a type of acceptance testing which is done before the product is released to customers. Performed internally within the organization
	- Beta Testing : The beta test is conducted at one or more customer sites by the end-user of the software. This version is released for a limited number of users for testing in a real-time environment
	- System Testing : performed on a complete integrated system to evaluate the compliance of the system with the corresponding requirements
	- Performance Testing: Performance Testing is a type of software testing that is carried out to test the speed, scalability, stability and reliability of the software product or application.
	- Load Testing: Load Testing is a type of software Testing which is carried out to determine the behavior of a system or software product under extreme load.
	- Stress Testing: Stress Testing is a type of software testing performed to check the robustness of the system under the varying loads.
	- Security Testing

Q. Stubs and Drivers
A. Stubs and Drivers are the dummy programs in Integration testing used to facilitate the software testing activity. These programs act as a substitutes for the missing models in the testing. They do not implement the entire programming logic of the software module but they simulate data communication with the calling module while testing.
	- Stub: Is called by the Module under Test.
	- Driver: Calls the Module to be tested.

Q. Database Management System
A. DBMS is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while considering appropriate security measures.

Q. Database
A. A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.

Q. Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS)
A. A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.

Q. Codd's Rule for Relational DBMS
A. 
	- Rule 1: Information rule - All information(including metadata) is to be represented as stored data in cells of tables. The rows and columns have to be strictly unordered.
	- Rule 2: Guaranted Access - Each unique piece of data(atomic value) should be accesible by : Table Name + Primary Key(Row) + Attribute(column).
	- Rule 3: Systematic treatment of NULL - Null has several meanings, it can mean missing data, not applicable or no value. It should be handled consistently. Expression on NULL must give null.
	- Rule 4: Active Online Catalog - Database dictionary(catalog) is the structure description of the complete Database and it must be stored online. The Catalog must be governed by same rules as rest of the database. The same query language should be used on catalog as used to query database.
	- Rule 5: Powerful and Well-Structured Language - One well structured language must be there to provide all manners of access to the data stored in the database. Example: SQL, etc. If the database allows access to the data without the use of this language, then that is a violation.
	- Rule 6: View Updation Rule - All the view that are theoretically updatable should be updatable by the system as well.
	- Rule 7: Relational Level Operation - There must be Insert, Delete, Update operations at each level of relations. Set operation like Union, Intersection and minus should also be supported.
	- Rule 8: Physical Data Independence - The physical storage of data should not matter to the system. If say, some file supporting table is renamed or moved from one disk to another, it should not effect the application.
	- Rule 9: Logical Data Independence - If there is change in the logical structure(table structures) of the database the user view of data should not change. Say, if a table is split into two tables, a new view should give result as the join of the two tables. This rule is most difficult to satisfy.
	- Rule 10: Integrity Independence - The database should be able to enforce its own integrity rather than using other programs. Key and Check constraints, trigger etc, should be stored in Data Dictionary. This also make RDBMS independent of front-end.
	- Rule 11: Distribution Independence - A database should work properly regardless of its distribution across a network. Even if a database is geographically distributed, with data stored in pieces, the end user should get an impression that it is stored at the same place. This lays the foundation of distributed database.
	- Rule 12: Nonsubversion Rule - If low level access is allowed to a system it should not be able to subvert or bypass integrity rules to change the data. This can be achieved by some sort of looking or encryption.

Q. What is Database Normalization ?
A. Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy from a relation or set of relations. Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion and updation anomalies.
	- 1st Normal Form : A relation is in 1NF, if every attribute in that relation is singled valued attribute.
	- 2nd Normal Form : A relation is in 2NF, if it has No Partial Dependency, i.e., no non-prime attribute (attributes which are not part of any candidate key) is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the table.
	- 3rd Normal Form : A relation is in 3NF, if there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes as well as it is in second normal form.
	- Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) : A relation is in BCNF iff in every non-trivial functional dependency X –> Y, X is a super key.

Q. OSI Model
A. The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. It consists of 7 Layers
	- Physical Layer : Is concerned with electrically or optically transmitting raw unstructured data bits across the network
	- Data Link Layer :  Directly connected nodes are used to perform node-to-node data transfer where data is packaged into frames. The data link layer also corrects errors that may have occurred at the physical layer.
	- Network Layer :  Responsible for receiving frames from the data link layer, and delivering them to their intended destinations among based on the addresses contained inside the frame.
	- Transport Layer : Manages the delivery and error checking of data packets. It regulates the size, sequencing, and ultimately the transfer of data between systems and hosts. One of the most common examples of the transport layer is TCP or the Transmission Control Protocol.
	- Session Layer : The session layer controls the conversations between different computers. A session or connection between machines is set up, managed, and termined at layer 5. Session layer services also include authentication and reconnections.
	- Presentation Layer : The presentation layer formats or translates data for the application layer based on the syntax or semantics that the application accepts. This layer can also handle the encryption and decryption required by the application layer.
	- Application Layer : At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact directly with the software application. This layer sees network services provided to end-user applications such as a web browser.

Q. TCP/IP Model
A.  Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is actual implementation of standard protocols. It consists of 5 layers
	- Application Layer : It looks out for hardware addressing and the protocols present in this layer allows for the physical transmission of data
	- Transport Layer : It defines the protocols which are responsible for logical transmission of data over the entire network.
		# Internet Protocol
		# ICMP
		# ARP
	- Internet Layer : It is responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data.
		# TCP
		# UDP
	- Network Access Layer
		# HTTP and HTTPS
		# SSH
		# NTP

Q. What is Deadlock
A. In an operating system, a deadlock occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting state because a requested system resource is held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process. (URL : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-deadlocks-in-operating-system)
	- Deadlock can arise if the following four conditions hold simultaneously (Necessary Conditions) also called Coffman Conditions
		# Mutual Exclusion: One or more than one resource are non-shareable (Only one process can use at a time) 
		# Hold and Wait: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for resources. 
		# No Preemption: A resource cannot be taken from a process unless the process releases the resource. 
		# Circular Wait: A set of processes are waiting for each other in circular form. 
	- There are three ways to handle deadlock 
		# Deadlock prevention or avoidance: The idea is to not let the system into a deadlock state.  Banker’s algorithm (Which is in-turn a gift from Dijkstra) in order to avoid deadlock. 
		# Deadlock detection and recovery: Let deadlock occur, then do preemption to handle it once occurred. 
		# Ignore the problem altogether: If deadlock is very rare, then let it happen and reboot the system. This is the approach that both Windows and UNIX take. 

Q. What is Startvation ?
A. Starvation happens if a method is indefinitely delayed. This can emerge once a method needs a further resource for execution that isn’t assigned. Starvation is the problem that occurs when low priority processes get jammed for an unspecified time as the high priority processes keep executing.


Q. What is Aging ?
A. To avoid starvation, we use the concept of Aging. In Aging, after some fixed amount of time quantum, we increase the priority of the low priority processes. 

Q. What is Kernal ?
A. The kernel is a computer program considered as a central component or module of OS. It is responsible for handling, managing, and controlling all operations of computer systems and hardware. It also acts as an interface between user applications and hardware.
